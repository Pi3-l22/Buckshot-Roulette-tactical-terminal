## ☢️ Overview

**Buckshot Roulette Tactical Terminal** is a cross-platform desktop application designed to give you the ultimate edge in *Buckshot Roulette*. Built with a dark, wasteland-style CRT terminal interface, it not only tracks the state of the gun but also uses a heuristically evaluated decision tree to recommend the absolute best course of action at any given moment.

> *Never guess again. Know your odds, track your items, and secure the kill.*

## ✨ Core Features

* **Real-time Probability Radar**: Instantly calculates the exact probability of the next shot being LIVE (🔴) or BLANK (⚪) based on the remaining unknown bullets.
* **Decision Assist Engine**: Provides tiered tactical advice (S/A/B/C):
  * **[S-Tier] Absolute Kill**: Recommends lethal combos (e.g., Inverter + Handsaw) when lethal damage is guaranteed.
  * **[A-Tier] High Value**: Recommends using Cigarettes or taking a safe shot at yourself for an extra turn.
  * **[B-Tier] Information Gathering**: Suggests using the Magnifying Glass, Burner Phone, or Adrenaline when blind.
  * **[C-Tier] Probabilistic Gambles**: Guides you on when to use Handcuffs and shoot the dealer based on percentage odds.
* **Item Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of all your items and the dealer's state (Handcuffed, Sawed barrel).
* **Smart Round Management**: Automatically inherits surviving HP from the previous round when reloading a new magazine.
* **Immersive UI**: Fully responsive, dark-mode terminal aesthetic complete with CRT scanlines and vignette effects.
